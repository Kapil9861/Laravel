first added it to fillable inside the model
Then placed the validation or move the image to the certain location:
if($request->hasfile('logo')){
    $formfields['logo']=$request->file('logo')->store('logos','public');
}
//This one is completely optional{
CHANGED THE     'default' => env('FILESYSTEM_DISK', 'public'),
 +++++ second parameter from the local to public 
}

breakdown of it: first the hasfile checks if it has file from the request 
then inside the formfield the file is stored in a seperate location HERE:
 LOGOS INSIDE PUBLIC folder

 Also added the section in the migration file
 $table->string('logo')->nullable();
 After this must rerun the migration file for updating the table with the logo field
Also for accessing the storage folder inside the public folder
Artisan Command:
php artisan storage:link

displayed the image in website:
changed the src to the filename
with       src="{{$listing->logo ? asset('storage/'.$listing->logo) : asset('images/no-image.png')}}"
using ternary operation
